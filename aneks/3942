Malfurion goes to the emerald dream and says goodbye to Tyrande:<br>– "can't leave you without sex for so long, so i bought you a &lt;fucktron-5000&gt; in Gnomeregan"<br>Tiranda:<br>– "...how could you think of that!...i would never cheat on you!"<br>Malfurion:<br>– "...well...so be it....If you ever change your mind, just shout – "Illidan to me" and he will do its job.<br>Malfurion falls asleep. Two weeks ago, &lt;fucktron-5000&gt; is catching Tyrande's eye all the time.<br>Tyrande thinks:<br>– " sorry of course for the justice points spent on it. Should I try? Did the gnomes strive for nothing."<br>Tyrend decides.<br>– "Illidan, to me"<br>8 hours of crazy, non-stop sex, her forces leave her, but there's one problem, She doesn't know how to turn him off. Haggard, she crawls to the window, peeks out and sees Maiev in the courtyard who is hunting some criminal in the bushes.<br>Tyrande:<br>– "...Maiev! There's a job worth a bottle of refreshing spring water! Shout – "Illidan to me"<br>Maiev, not thinking for long:<br>– "...Illidan to me!"<br>One and a half months later, Malfurion wakes up, Lorlathil's walls all covered in fel, no nightelves around, Maiev appears from around the corner holding a &lt;Felgibber shotgun&gt; instead of glaive, unshaven, red-eyed, her pants torn apart on her ass.<br>Malfurion:<br>– "Maiev, what happened? Where is EVERYONE????"<br>Maiev:<br>– "...Shut the fuck up! Don't know of everyone but ILLIDAN IS SOMEWHERE HERE<br><br>_____<br><br>God bless George the Screamer
