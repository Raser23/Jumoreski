Моя сестра в третьем, а я умнее ее! Думаю, я тоже должен учиться в третьем!"<br><br>  For the teacher it was too much. She took the boy to the director and explained the whole situation. The director thought, and said to the boy: "I'll take the test, and if you can not answer any of the questions, then return back to the first grade, and will behave well."<br>The boy agreed.<br><br>- How much is 3 x 3?<br><br>- 9<br><br>- How much is 6 x 6?<br><br>- 36<br><br>And so it went with every question that, according to the director, a third-grader should know the answer.

По-моєму в одному з циклів в алгоритмі коду гуморески стався якийсь збій: оповідач шпарить по-англійськи, ви-теж лопочете по-англійськи, хлопчик відповідає російською, а я зараз взагалі став українською мовою розмовляти.
