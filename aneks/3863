A man walks on the street and sees a big queue. When he asks, what does everyone waits for, he is answered that Dogger-Boorbogger are in stock. "What the hell is this?" he wonders, but noone knows exactly, and this is why the queue is so big. The man decide to wait with the rest. <br>When he has waited long enough, he asks "Give me 500g of these Doggers-Boorboggers". "We are terribly sorry", the shop assistant apologised, "The Doggers-Boorboggers are all sold out. But we have some Horses-Boorborses left!"<br>The man scratches his head, thinking. "Okay, give me some Horses then"<br>The shop assistants wraps up some for him, and the man leaves. Upon arriving home, he quickly unwraps the bag, looks inside, and sees Doggers-Boordoggers.
