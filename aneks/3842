Election night in America. Votes counted, but looks like it's a tie. So, Obama decides to organise an actual race. <br>He says to Trump and Hillary:"The one, who will run around White House and be the fastest will win election."<br>Hillary running first. Obama fires in air and she goes. After around 20 minutes she finishes her run sweating and almost dying. Obama nodes, and tell Trump to get ready.<br>Barack fires again. Trump litterally shoots from start, his wig flies of his head. Time passes, and he comes back, sweat and autotan dripping from him. Obama looks at the time: 13 minutes.<br>"HELL YEAH, I WIN! Suck it Hillary, you stupid bitch!" - Trump says.<br>"Yeah, yeah, my congratulations, Donald" - Obama answer him with grim face.<br>"Damn, whoa... I was fast! Didn't I set some kind of record?" - asks Trump.<br><br>Obama answers: "No. Bush did 9:11."
