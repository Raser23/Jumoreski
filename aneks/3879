-Nastya, what you have already learned from Phil?<br>-To do remakes... <br>(laughing)<br>I don't want you photographed me, I'm tired of you. I'm sick of your pink blouse, your boobs and your microphone.<br>-Do you mind if we write it like that?<br>-I don' fucking care how you will write it. I don't like non-professionals, non-professionals have nothing to do here. You want me to go away from here? I will. But I willn't, because I respect your colleagues, and you will get away from here... Get away! Stand up and left!!!<br>-Is this normal in your opinion?<br>-Yes it is. Stand up and left! ... You should be prepared to come to visit star's conferences. Not as you: yesterday - nearby the side streets, today - here, on the second row. ... Enough. Goodbye.<br>-Okay. Goodbye. Star....<br>-Uh-uh, yeah... Vagina.
