Звонит Эминем в дом глухонемых, и говорит:<br>"Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma<br>You assumin' I'm a human<br>What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman<br>Innovative and I'm made of rubber<br>So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me<br>And it'll glue to you and<br>I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating<br>How to give a mothafuckin' audience a feelin' like it's levitating<br>Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting<br>For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating<br>‘Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated<br>I make elevating music, you make elevator music"<br>А ему отвечают:<br>"Ничего не понятно"
