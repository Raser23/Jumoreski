Two Jews go a tailor, their names are Marcus and Shlomo, <br>the tailor's name is Pincus. <br>So they say: <br>- Pincus we want you to make us suits from the blackest cloth available! <br>- Ok, I will use the same cloth I make nun's clothes out of. It's the blackest cloth imaginable! <br>They say: <br>- Ok, good<br>So they pick up their suits a week later, <br>wearing them down the street. <br>They see some nuns. <br>Shlomo goes up to one, takes her sleeve, puts it next to his own, says something to his friend, and then they leave. <br>One nun says: <br>- What did he just say to you?<br>The other nun says:<br>- I'm not sure, I think it was in Latin. <br>So she said: <br>- Well what was it?<br>The other nun says: <br>- He said, "marcus pincus fuctus."
