Once Gorhock, Hoi and Letov met to drink some alcohol. They bought one litre of portwine, and decided - as we are poets, let's ask in rhymes - how many who will ask, that will get so portwine.<br><br>Hoi begins:<br><br>Fish is swimming in the bottom <br>I will drink ryumku odnottom.<br><br>He got one glass of portwine, Gorhsock continues:<br><br>Fish is dead on dne<br>I will drink dve.<br><br>Letov gets up, gets hard and red, and suddenly begins to shout: <br>AAAAAAAAAAA BLYAD NAHOOOY, then took the litre and ran away.<br><br>(i'm very good in rifma's)
